        Our laboratory studies transmission of plant pathogens by insects. Research is aimed at understanding ecological and molecular aspects of plant–insect–pathogen interactions.

        We use **Zebra Chip (ZC)**, an emergent disease affecting solanaceous plants, as a model system. The causative agent, *Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum*, is an alpha-proteobacterium vectored by the potato/tomato psyllid *Bactericera cockerelli*.

        ### Current ZC projects
        1. Molecular and ecological interactions between pathogen and vector  
        2. Effects of plant-induced defenses on vectors and other herbivorous insects  
        3. Effects of pathogen transmission on tri-trophic interactions  

        Other projects in the lab include studies of virus transmission by aphids, bacteria–insect interactions, and the biology of the Asian citrus psyllid (*Diaphorina citri*).
